This is my repository for a bootcamp project through Hack for Impact - Cal Poly SLO.

In the "milestone 3" folder, you can find all of the code needed to use this project.

The bootcamp project was a project I worked on during my fall quarter of 2022. The goal of this project was to learn and apply the MERN framework in a full stack project.
